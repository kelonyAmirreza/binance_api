To create an RSA key for the Spot Test Network on Binance using OpenSSL, follow these steps:

1. Install OpenSSL on your computer if it is not already installed.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the RSA key.

   `cd /path/to/directory`

3. Enter the following command to create a private key:

   `openssl genrsa -out binance-test-prv.pem 2048`

   This will generate a private key with AES-256 encryption and save it in a file named `binance-test-prv.pem`.

4. Enter the following command to extract the public key from the private key:

   `openssl rsa -in binance-test-prv.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out binance-test-pub.pem`

   This extracts the public key from the private key and saves it in a file named `binance-test-pub.pem`.

5. Your RSA key pair is now created and can be used for the Spot Test Network on Binance. You should keep the private key secret and secure, while sharing the public key with others as necessary.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
